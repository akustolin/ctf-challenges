<h3>PHP 4.0.0 Released!</h3>
May 22, 2000.  It's here, it's ready, and it has the long awaited 'Release'
tag.  The successor of PHP 3.0 has finally been released.  At this point, everyone is
encouraged to begin upgrading their systems to use this version.
<a href="downloads.php">Download it now!</a>  Some more PHP 4.0 related can be found
<a href="/version4">here</a>.

<h3>PHP 4 Release Candidate 2</h3>

May 10, 2000. The PHP Group is proud to announce the release of the <a
href="version4/">second release candidate of the upcoming PHP 4.0</a>. 
Highlights of this release include
support for new web servers (Zeus, Netscape Enterprise, Apache Win32 module),
improved portability of the Unix build framework and tons of bug fixes.
We expect this to be the final release candidate before PHP 4.0.

<h3>PHP 3.0.16 released</h3>
April 05, 2000. PHP 3.0.16 was released. This is mostly a bug fix release which
adds support for gd-1.8, ucd-snmp 4.1, and high-resolution timers on OS/2.
OpenBSD support has been improved considerably. The source package and
Win32 binaries are available from the PHP homepage. The 
<a href="ChangeLog.php3">ChangeLog</a> contains a
full list of changes.

<h3>PHP 4 Release Candidate 1</h3>
The real thing is getting closer and closer.  After a very successful Beta 4
release that was extremely stable, <a href="version4/">PHP 4.0</a> shifts gears from the beta cycle into 
<a href="version4/downloads.php">release-quality RC1.</a>
If all goes well and no outstanding bugs are found in the RC, the final
version of PHP will be released sometime.

<h3>What is PHP?</h3>
<P>
PHP is a server-side, cross-platform, HTML embedded scripting language.  
If you are completely new to PHP and want to get some idea of how it works, 
have a look at the <a href="tut.php">Introductory Tutorial</a>.  Once you get
beyond that have a look at the example archive sites and some of the other
resources available in the <a href="links.php">Links</a> section.
</P>

<h3>So, how much does it cost?</h3>
<P>
This may sound a little foreign to all you folks coming from a non-Unix
background, but PHP doesn't cost anything.  You can use it for commercial
and/or non-commercial use all you want.  You can give it to your friends,
print it out and hang it on your wall or eat it for lunch.  Welcome to
the world of <a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</a> software!  
Smile, be happy, the world is good.  For the full legalese, see the 
official <a href="license.html">license</a>.
</P>

<h3>Year 2000 Compliance</h3>
Just like your C compiler or your favourite text editor, PHP is just about as
year 2000 compliant as your pencil.  If you're still worried (perhaps all
pencils are built to break on December 31st 1999?) -
<a href="y2k.php">read this</a>.
